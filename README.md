# extremeBassBoost

## How to use this program:

- Install VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device: https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/
- In Windows sound settings set "Speakers" volume to maximum.
- In Windows sound settings set your default *output* device to "CABLE Input" and also set volume to maximum.
- Start Extreme Bass Boost application. Set *input* to "CABLE Output" and *output* to "Speakers".
- Set volume of your application (eg. a music player) to maximum. Set your preferred volume in extremeBassBoost application ("Master volume" slider).
- Press "Start".

## How it works:

Extreme Bass Boost works by increasing proportion of low frequency sounds compared to other sounds. This is only possible when overall volume is lowered, so that there is room for amplified bass. So this program in fact just makes high frequencies very quiet. But this still can produce suprisingly good sounding results.

Be warned that you have to check for too high amplification yourself, this bass boost is quite dirty. When sound gets amplified too much, red "CLIPPING" text appears and the signal is distorted. You have to experiment with the sliders to find out what setting works best for you.

## For best results:
- Use headphones.
- Start with no bass boost and zero volume.
- Then slowly increase master volume.
- Then slowly increase bass boost. The lower you set master volume, the more bass boost you can get without distortion.
- Adjust filter frequency to your preference.
